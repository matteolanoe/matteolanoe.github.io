Hi! My name is MattÃ©o LanoÃ« and I am a first-year Sociology PhD Candidate between the [Center for Research on social InequalitieS (CRIS)](https://www.sciencespo.fr/cris/en/) at Sciences Po and the [Mortality, Health and Epidemiology](https://mse.site.ined.fr/en/) research unit at [Ined](https://www.ined.fr). My research is supervised by Anne Revillard at CRIS, and Ã‰milie Counil at Ined. I am funded by the Sciences Po School of Research Doctoral Scholarship, for the 2025-2028 period. 

What Am I Interested In? 
======

**Dissertation Title: When the Virus Strains: Life Course, Dispositions and Illness Trajectories of Post-Acute Infectious Syndromes**(provisional title). 

My PhD research project lies at the intersection of sociology of health and illness, medical sociology, sociology of socialization and dispositionnalist sociology. I am interested in the social-biological interactions which produce unequal health and social outcomes. My particular focus is on what is called 'post-acute infectious syndrome', that is a subtype of chronic illness and symptoms resulting from the infection of an infectious disease (such as, Covid-19, for instance). My main interest relies on studying how embodied and socialized dispositions are getting used in the health context and how, in turn, the health context shape the late socializationâ€”modeling and modifying the primary one, previously incorporated. 

Besides, I also dive into issues related to political science, electoral sociology, sociology of education, and the use of methods (either qualitative or quantitative) for social inquiry.
