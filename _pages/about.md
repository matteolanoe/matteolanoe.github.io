Hi! My name is MattÃ©o LanoÃ« and I am a first-year Sociology PhD Candidate between the [Center for Research on social InequalitieS (CRIS)](https://www.sciencespo.fr/cris/en/) at Sciences Po and the [Mortality, Health and Epidemiology](https://mse.site.ined.fr/en/) research unit at [Ined](https://www.ined.fr). My research is supervised by Anne Revillard at CRIS, and Ã‰milie Counil at Ined. I am funded by the Sciences Po School of Research Doctoral Scholarship, for the 2025-2028 period. 

What Am I Interested In? 
======

**Dissertation Title:** 

_**When the Virus Strains: Life Course, Dispositions and Illness Trajectories of Post-Acute Infectious Syndromes**_ (provisional). 

My PhD research project lies at the intersection of sociology of health and illness, medical sociology, sociology of socialization and dispositionnalist sociology. I am interested in the social-biological interactions which produce unequal health and social outcomes. My particular focus is on what's called 'post-acute infectious syndrome,' a subtype of chronic illness and symptoms resulting from the infection of an infectious disease (such as, Covid-19, for instance). My main interest relies on studying how embodied and socialized dispositions are getting used in the health context and how, in turn, the health outcomes shape the late socialization â€” modeling and modifying the primary one, previously incorporated. 

Besides, I also dive into issues related to political science, electoral sociology, sociology of education, and the use of methods (either qualitative or quantitative) for social inquiry.

My side projects
======

For five years up to now, I have been a member of the editorial board of the [Electoral Bulletin of the European Union (BLUE)](https://geopolitique.eu/numeros/elections-en-europe-2024/), a review published by the Groupe d'Ã©tudes gÃ©opolitiques based at the ENS. We publish bi-annual issues, covering elections taking place within the European continent. The publication process is done under the merry guidance of [FranÃ§ois Hublet](https://hblt.eu), our great editor-in-chief!

Last year, along with my cohort comrade [Ã‰loi Bitri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/Ã©loi-bitri-893b77338/?originalSubdomain=fr) (School of Research '25; please read his [amazing thesis here!](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/sites/sciencespo.fr.ecole-recherche/files/BITRI-Eloi.pdf)), we started the project of a graduate review based in the School of Research -- that is now entitled the **Sciences Po Graduate Review (SPGR)**. After having recruited a wonderful and dedicated team of editors, we launched our first [call for submissions](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/en/news/call-for-contributions-sciences-po-graduate-review/), on the School of Research website! If you are a master's or doctoral student enrolled at the School of Research, do not hesitate to submit a piece :)
